- Hello World 😉, my name is Ine. 
- I am taking a 2️⃣-year evening class 'Data Scientist' @Syntra.
- In this class, we will be working with Python 🐍
- Note that this is brand new to me ❗I have no background in programming, at all❗
- I am convinced that this will show in my (🔰) code. 
- ✨ On that note; I am keen on and grateful for receiving feedback or suggestions ✨
